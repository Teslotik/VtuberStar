# VtuberStar

VtuberStar is a visual novel made in 45 days.

The goal of this project was to test a new modular architecture build on top of Godot game engine.

The architecture consists of entities, factories, state machines (FSTM and NFA) callbacks and a plugin system.

You can start exploring code from the `Rules.cs` file. The `Rules` class is a resource locator and also used for factories registration
